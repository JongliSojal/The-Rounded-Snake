This is a very simple game created with p5.js, a javascript library for "Processing" tasks. To keep the algorithm simple, the snake is represented as a circle, not like actual snake games with head and tail. The player has to use the arrow key to move the snake and pass through the food. Hitting the border will reset the game.
